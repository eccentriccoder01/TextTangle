## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eccentriccoder01/TextTangle.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd TextTangle
    ```

3.  **Open with a Live Server:**
    You can simply open `index.html` directly in your browser, or for a better development experience (especially for features like API calls), use a local server:
      * If you have VS Code, use the "Live Server" extension.
      * Alternatively, if you have Node.js installed, you can install `http-server` globally:
        ```bash
        npm install -g http-server
        ```
        Then navigate to your project directory and run:
        ```bash
        http-server
        ```
    Your default browser will open the application, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` or `http://localhost:8080`.
